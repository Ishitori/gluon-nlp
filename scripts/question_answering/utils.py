    and looks like ``"1,2,1+2,3-1"``.

    We allow the following kinds of combinations: ``x``, ``x*y``, ``x+y``, ``x-y``, and ``x/y``,
    where ``x`` and ``y`` are positive integers less than or equal to ``len(tensors)``.  Each of
    the binary operations is performed elementwise.  You can give as many combinations as you want
    in the ``combination`` string.  For example, for the input string ``"1,2,1*2"``, the result
    would be ``[1;2;1*2]``, as you would expect, where ``[;]`` is concatenation along the last
    dimension.

    If you have a fixed, known way to combine tensors that you use in a model, you should probably
    just use something like ``ndarray.cat([x_tensor, y_tensor, x_tensor * y_tensor])``.  This
    function adds some complexity that is only necessary if you want the specific combination used
    to be `configurable`.

    If you want to do any element-wise operations, the tensors involved in each element-wise
    operation must have the same shape.

    floats with fully-masked vectors will likely give you ``nans``.
